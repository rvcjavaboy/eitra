		ranjit@ranjit-Vostro-1540:~/play$ cp -i /home/ranjit/cmd cmd

		ranjit@ranjit-Vostro-1540:~/play$cp passwd /home/ranjit/linux


Copy multiple files into another directory, using a wildcard:
	
		ranjit@ranjit-Vostro-1540:~/play$ranjit@ranjit-Vostro-1540:~/play$ cp * d/
		cp: omitting directory 'd'
		ranjit@ranjit-Vostro-1540:~/play$cp *.jpg /d/jpegfile

Copy an entire directory structure into another location:

		ranjit@ranjit-Vostro-1540:~/play$cp -R /home/ranjit /d

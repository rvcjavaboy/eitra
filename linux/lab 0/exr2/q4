QUES 4. What is the difference between Hard link and Symbolic link.

What are Hard Links

1. Hard Links have same inodes number.
2. ls -l command shows all the links with the link column showing the number of links.
3. Links have actual file contents
4. Removing any link, just reduces the link count but doesn't affect the other links.
5. You cannot create a Hard Link for a directory.
6. Even if the original file is removed, the link will still show you the contents of the file.
What are Soft Links

1. Soft Links have different inodes numbers.
2. ls -l command shows all links with second column value 1 and the link points to original file.
3. Soft Link contains the path for original file and not the contents.
4. Removing soft link doesn't affect anything but when the original file is removed, the link becomes a 'dangling' link that points to nonexistent file.
5. A Soft Link can link to a directory.
